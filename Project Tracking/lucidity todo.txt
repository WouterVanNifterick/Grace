     BUGS
=============================================================================
Bug
- Andy reports the Voice Mod frame tab text is too large and overflows 
  over the tabs.

bug
- play length indicator is incorrect when trigger mode is one shot or loop off.
  the play length indicator shows the looped area. 

bug 
- Look at SFZ loading for "Yamaha C7 Piano.sfz"
  The group opcodes are also applied to all the sub-region opcodes. How can this behaviour be
  mimiced in my SFZ parser. 
  I think i will need some sort of inheirted opcode system. 

bug
- I think the start update / end update calls become out of sync sometimes when loading
  SFZ files. 

bug
- replace sample with SFZ file. 
  there is an unsupported file format error, but a region is still created.

- refresh file browser doesn't maintain the browser node selection. the selection jumps.
- re-saving a patch, if selected in the browser, will cause the browser selection
  to jump up one item.


bug
- two key groups. Delete the focused key group. GUI doesn't update with 
  new key group parameters.

i've written a class to set a "WinEventHook". I should do the same for 
the windows keyboard hook. Currently the windows keyboard hook is
a bit messy and spread out over lots of code.


> Also, could i ask some more in-depth info about the 2pole filter 
> "gain" knob ?
The gain knob is pre-filter. The goal of the gain knob is to add some extra harmonics. Not adjust the gain so much. Thinking about it now, instead of gain, it might be better to label it "Timbre" or "Distortion" or something else. 

Mix parameters for all the filter types?

why aren't samples found for yann's patches?

opening/closing the sample map window is slow!!! 

Update the step sequencer divisions to match the LFO step divisions. 

Auto region select causes the sample display to flicker when not actually changing
what controls are visible. 

Polyphony task
- when re-triggering an already existing note, lucidity currently just
  plays another one so that it overlaps. Perhaps it would
  be better to do a slow release. Maybe half current release time 
  or something.

- Lucidity should reload samples if changes are detected. Should just check last save date to begin with. Not too complicated!

- The mod slot needs something to indicate the mod slot is being used.

- error region colors need to be more obvious!

Loop point modulation should be unique to the region. Then have an option
to apply loop modulation to all regions in the key group. 

- smart loading of multiple samples. Samples should be mapped according to their root note if
  it is detected in the filename. 
  -- this will require a dialog popping up in the Lucidity GUI. 

- have a command to select all samples.
- have a command to reset region root notes to those found in the sample filename.

[FEATURE REQUEST] Ask Yann about this command. What should it do. Why not copy and move to new group. 
"copy a sample into a new group" 
"rename all selected samples" would be good feature to have two. the rename would add the root key.

PS : one thing that i *really*don't like in Lucidity, is that the default patch has everything disabled by default (the volume is set at zero, the enveloppe release is set at zero too, so as soon as you load a sound, you expect to hear it when hitting a key but it is actually muted) : is it by design, or could it be changed in a forthcoming version ?

[FEATURE REQUEST] Yann
1 - Would it be possible to navigate in the keymapper using key arrows ( left/right to skip to previous / next sample, and up/down to skip to the other veolicty layer). It would speed up the workflow, allowing 2 hands work.

Instead of the gui polling the plugin to see what region/key group is in focus
in multiple places, I should use the messaging system to trigger a focus change.
-- work in progress. 
   -- the Plugin.FocusedKeyGroup and Plugin.FocusedRegion should be members of the GUI state I believe. 
-- NOTE: I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Maybing I'm making busy work. 
   -- but then I think it is, because the all parts of the GUI would always know what the focused regions 
      are, by keeping a record of those regions. The GUI then could broadcast changes of focus. Individual 
      parts of the GUI can update themselves if the focused region is different. Otherwise they can ignore 
      the change.


the browser should save it's state when the GUI is closed and reopended.
-- it should also refresh itself after being reopened. 

the browser + icons used to show folders don't change to - icons when a folder
is expanded. (They should!)

TDynArray. This is a wrapper around delphi's dynamic arrays. It might be useful to use.
It might also be useful for inspiration for my own TSimpleList classes in VamLib.Collections.lists.pas.

[BIG TASK]
Instead of using individual timers on the GUI to drive repeating tasks. I should have
one master timer that can either send out 'pings' via the zero object system. Or some
alternative form of registering a timer request. 
-- What about targets requiring different timer rates.


- sample context menus 'clear MARKER modulation' should be grayed out if 
  no modulation is active.

create new screen shot without the drum loop. The amen loop is misleading 
because Lucidity isn't a loop sampler. 

- changing sample focus in the sample map should zoom all the way out. (by sending a zero object message)


--------Optimisation Ideas----------------------------------------------------
-- instead of caluclating the LFO, Env and Seq values each step, maybe 
   use some sort of approximation. The mod sources will be calculated at some 
   lower control rate while, while updated at a faster rate using something 
   like: 
   	CurrentValue := CurrentValue + StepSize. 
   StepSize will be calculated at the control rate. Whatever it is. 

  Using a scheme like this, it's possible that the "Slow Control Rate" 
  value could be updated 10 times a second or less. The modulation sources
  could be interpolated at the faster control rate or audio rate.

-- The process loop is a little deep at the moment. There are multiple loops.
   Consider: there is the key group processing loop to process all values 
   that belong to this loop. 
   Instead. Each voice should be pointed to an output buffer. Voices could
   then be processed in one group.

Right Click and Hold for sample zoom with mouse
- Left/Right moves the offset.
- Up/Down zooms in/out

- would be good to figure out the text drawing and use a higher quality text drawing routine!

- Update the installer so that Default.lpg isn't overwritten. (the default patch.)

- might need a 'reverse sample' command.

- look at more mouse wheel support!

- Current parameters are quantised at the knob level. (Tune is the only
  parameter being quantised so far.) It would be good to quantise the same
  parameter when input by MIDI Automation or VST Parameter Automation.  

- Need to respond when samples are missing.
  - need to be able to right click the sample display that show "audio file not found"
    the context menu should give options for finding or replacing the sample with another.

- An auto select on MIDI input would be nice.

- A move all regions to separate key groups would be nice. When moving to a new
  key group, current key group settings should be duplicated.

- Trigger region when pressing on key zone.

- clicking on sample name in sample display should pop up list of other samples. 
  perhaps divided by key group.

 - Sample map. load a patch with a missing sample so that the sample map shows a red region.
   Highlight and select the region. The region is red but the highlight is blue. It creates
   an ugly purple color. It should be a red highlight for error samples. 

- key zone context menu needs a 'Move Key Zone to New Key Group'




-- Able to save samples in project file.
Saving the samples inside the project file is a very important feature for me and my friends,  since we remix each other and exchange sequencer project files. Having external wav file dependencies is a no go for us. We tried it before and it didnt work. There were always files missing. Saving multi gigabyte sample libraries inside fxp doesnt make any sense, but we make our own patches and the size never exceeds 10 or 20 mb. Currently we are using directwave,  wich works as we want,  but lately its been feeling kind of bloated and that is why we are looking for an alternative.

* Lucidity Notes from Yann
I noticed a couple of quirks, bugs & strange behaviour, so i wanted to report it :
- If i copy an instance of Lucidity from one Reaper track into another (with samples i drag/dropped from the DAW, not 

from Lucidity's own browser), the audio content will play fine, but no sample is visible in the keymapper (but i see the 

red keys blinkning when a note is triggered). So, i can not edit the samples or maps, as i can't see it.
- The "magnetism" ("grid locking" ?) of the keymapper is not perfect yet : i like gridlocking a lot (as it is a 

timesaver), but here sometimes i can not smoothly change the mapping when i drag a zone border/handle : it is way too 

strong : instead of jumping from note to note, it keeps jumping from half an octave.

- currently each sample map has a bitmap rendering of its image for fast display.
  Instead try to use a "Peak Buffer" of bytes. The sample map will draw the
  peak buffer.
  -- Peak buffers are now in, but the implementation is a bit messy.
  The current setup is also causing lags when interacting with the GUI while the
  sample is redrawn.
  -- Continue working on the SampleImageRenderer class.
  --- SampleRenderer needs to be able to draw with offset and zoom.


sample display
- change pitch to Tune & Fine.

Sample map
- add scrollable Root Key, LowKey, High Key, Low Vel, High Vel fields.


* Check samples are saved using relative paths when saving programs.
* check that programs can be moved.
* try adding a draft playback mode using linear resampling.
** would use best sampling when rendering down.

* The key zone needs to put it's resize handles on the outside when the key zone
  is really small.

* Check output latency of resampler and how much quality adjustments
  change it.
* Look for all locks using in audio thread.
* knob menu should have a 'reset to default' command
* SFZ support example - http://www.linuxsampler.org/sfz/
* lofi filter needs to have it's sample rate reduction knob polarity reversed.
  -- I wonder if it's possible to scale the samplerate reduction to match the
     1 volt/octave to match pitch signals.
* add midi velocity as a mod source.
* about box needs to be completed.

* LOFI - Bit Depth knob needs to be reversed.


* Removing MtxVec would reduce the install file size and required memory.
  MtxVec is used for it's FFT routines. It's used by the filter FFT display.

  It would be great to have a sample store that would hold sample data.
  The sample data would be saved into the project file when a project file is saved.
  For this to work, sample data would need some type of finger print.

Step sequencer needs a mutate option.

- Mutate off: duh. No mutation
- Mutate : each triggered step has a 10% chance of mutating.
- Mutate-Reset : each triggered step has a 10% chance of mutating. Steps are reset to
    their original postion each time a note is triggered.

-- Mutate has been (partially) implemented but the mutated steps aren't
   reported by the GUI. Maybe as an option there needs to be some sort of group
   Step data object that all voices share. It feels a bit hacky... but
   it would allow for all voices to mutate steps and share the same mutated
   sequence. If voices mutate their own internal step values only, the sequencers

  ### Serial Numbers And Copy Protection ####

There is no freely available asymmetric encryption library for
delphi that is easily used. :(

consider trying to implement RSA key encryption myself...

- need to update the eeGlobals so that sample rate changed events and all
the other notify events are sent as constants.
All classes will register a listener and can listen out for all constants.
This will mean the same code will be used for samplerate change events
push other stuff through the channel so the CP stuff becomes obscured.

I am using TCriticallyDampedLowpass in a few places. One place is smoothing
the mod wheel, pitch bend and MIDI note values for monophonic signals.

behind the scenes TCriticallyDampedLowpass is using a biquad filter. Using
Direct Form 2 and Direct Form 2 Transposed topologies the filter will explode
with sudden changes in coefficients.

The filter doesn't explode using Direct Form 1. The downside is DF1 uses four
intermediate variables to store the filter state.

=============================================================================
Hotkeys

Hotkeys should be implemented as:

Two hotkey files
- Factory/Config/Hotkeys.xml 
- User/Config/Hotkeys.xml

Should the original user hotkeys replace or be loaded in addition to the factory config. Might be ok 
either way. It's possible the user config should only contain overrides. 


- All key presses should be directed to a 'key press' handler in the globals unit.
- The globals unit should then pass anything registered as a hotkey to the GUI (if it's open.)

- It should be possible for controls to set themselves or other objects to 
  be the focus of hot key presses in the globals unit. 
- It should be possible to define a default handler if nothing has focus.

- The globals unit should have no understanding of what the key presses mean, it should
  only pass the relevent commands to the focused control. The focused control then 
  has the option to process the key or not. 
  Pass the key press to the default handler if it's not processed. Then pass the
  key press to the host application if it's not processed again.

- This would be a good system to have and could be incorporated into Poise.


=============================================================================
======= Parameter Smoothing ==================================
- Look at adding parameter smoothing.
  -- There is smoothing in a couple places already. Knobs are smooth their output.
     Cool but maybe unnecessary.
  -- Modulated parameters are smoothed in the KeyGroup class.
     This does have a performance hit however. 
- The current parameter smoothing system might be enough for V1 but 
  smoothing at the parameter change point might be better in the long run.
  That way all parameters can be optionally smoothed and it might be easier to  
  port to other plugins.

- Destination Parameter (Filter 1 Parameter 1 etc)
- Scope - (Global/All Key Groups, Focused Key Group, Named Key Group)
- Mapping - maps the source control range to the destination parameter.

             Project Collaboration Folder
=============================================================================

I've been thinking about your collaboration requirements as well. I can't implement "save files in project" feature right away. As an alternative, what about a "Project Collaboration Folder" feature.

When starting a new project you would designate a Project Collaboration Folder (PCF). All Lucidity instances would save all files into the PCF.

When handing the project off to your partners, they would need to manually update the location of the PCF.

The Project Collaboration Folder location would only need to be set once the project is opened for the first time (on a new computer). You would be able to send a project back and forth and Lucidity would automagically remember where the project collaboration folder is for each machine.

The Project Collaboration Folder location would need to be updated if you change the name or location of the folder.

This functionality is outside the VST specification but it's possible it could be made to work with some experimentation on my part.

     POSSIBLE NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES
=============================================================================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Meta control parameter mapping ==

Control is needed for music creation. It's not enough to have a static patch. 

All knobs/parameters should be linked to a controller, the mod wheel for example. 
A mod-map or mod-graph translates the controller position to the actual parameter
value. The mod-graph is a break point line. 

At it's most simple, each parameter would be linked to a mod-map, each mod-map would
be linked to one controller. It would be a master meta control. This idea could be
advanced by allowing more meta controllers. Also, lfos could be used for meta controllers
as well. 

Current examples are Mutable Instruments Frames. The exp-map in Alchemy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe all the filters should have a filter mix amount know by default
in file parameter position four.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe instead of using key groups with completely independent voice settings
I could use four "sources" like in Alchemy. The routing would be fairly 
different. Four sources would be blended into one pair of filters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A "Whoosh" envelope. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change voice structure so Lucidity is using 4 key groups or "sources" 
like Alchemy. Use cross fading etc.
