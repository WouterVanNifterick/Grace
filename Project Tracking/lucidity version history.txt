Bug Fix: Parameter changes are applied to all voice groups.

=== v1.0.1 (10 Sep 2015) ===  

New: 
- Grace is now freeware. 
http://www.forum.onesmallclue.com/viewtopic.php?id=15

Change:
- Grace is now using Liberation sans font for GUI text. 
- using new debounce and throttling GUI code.

Bug Fix:
- Grace now works correctly when using large fonts in Windows. Previously 
  some text would be mis-sized.
- Some assembly code used in the filters was causing problems in the 64bit 
  build. The problem was very apparent in Tracktion 5.
- Some dialogs would show behind the GUI window. If not visible at all, the host
  application would appear to be hung. 
- Mod wheel now works.
- Browser preview player audio playback code has been rewritten and the playback quality 
  has been improved.
- Grace can load program files that use an <AlternateSampleDirectory> node.

=== v1.0 (26-Oct-2014) Release Candidate 1 ===
New:
- All filters now have a MIX parameter. 
- Finalised copy protection. Lucidity will not restore it's state when 
  a host project is loaded if it is not registered. 
- The Lucidity key file now uses a DAT extension instead of KEY. 
- Save Program Command added.
- Message dialogs now show in the VST window. Previously they would 
  show as pop up message dialog boxes. In some situations the messages
  would show behind the host application window giving the appearence 
  that the host application had crashed or frozen. 
- Now reports VST plugin latency. 
- XY Pads now boardcast parameter changes to the host so changes 
  can be recorded as VST parameter automation. 
- Can now save a program without including the samples. 
- rename program command (for internal use only.)
- Missing sample file search.
- Improved SFZ import: Sample regions now use values defined in the <group> opcode. Previously
  <group> opcodes were ignored. 
- New hotkey : DELETE to delete currently selected sample regions in sample map.

Change:
- Filter GAIN is now Filter TONE.

Bug Fix:
- Lucidity would freeze if loading a patch file using the ENTER key.   
- SFZ Import: Lucidity now uses a default key center value if none is
  specified. 

=== BETA v0.0.1.59 (25-Sep-2014) ===
New:
- Add select region with MIDI input.
- The AHDSR envelopes now have a "snap" mode. Snap mode allows for 
  instaneous attack and release times, which will cause clicks with some
  material. 
- Improved MIDI Map handling.
  -- default MIDI Map is now loaded on start up.
  -- added commands to the main menu to load and save MIDI maps. 
- MIDI Map Directory is now "LucidityData\Midi Maps"

Change:
- Added some more error handling to the "Show Manual" and "Show Data Folder"
  commands. 
- Changes to the internal messaging system. (MotherShip now has list locks
  for each zero object list.)
- Due to a bug fix the Lucidity patch file format is now version 3. 
  Backwards compatibility with version 2 patches has been maintained. 
- tweaked sample context menu commands for removing modulation.
- Save program dialog is now initialised with the current filename.   
- Tempo synced LFOs now sync to song position and tempo.

Bug Fix:
- GUI now updates when loading FXP patches. 
- Tweaked the sample map GUI elements. They now show the 
  region bounds for the selected region again. This used
  to work but was broken in the previous version. 
- the parameter amount display didn't disolve when finished holding a knob. 
- Random Smooth LFO output was out of range. 
- The comb filter delay buffer wasn't being cleared when triggering a 
  new voice. The old audio data would be recycled into the new voice.   
- Modulating the loop points could lead to a crash if the modulation point
  was outside the sample bounds. 
- Sometimes Lucidity would behave as if it was using Mono whilst in Poly
  voice mode. Lucidity wasn't releasing active voices when loading new
  programs. 
- the modulation depth amounts don't update after loading a patch.
- The [ENTER] key now loads the selected sample in the browser. 
- The comb filter had artifacts when changing the delay time
- 64bit installer put data files in the wrong location. It was placing them 
  in c:\ instead of c:\ProgramData\One Small Clue\Lucidity x64


=== BETA v0.0.1.51 (30-Aug-2014) ===
Change:
- Lucidity now only has one FXP slot.

Bug Fix:
- load sample function now works again. I broke this recently as well!
- possible fix for "access violation error" that sometimes
  occurs when mousing over the sample map. This error often results in
  an infinute loop of error messages. This fix needs to be tested to 
  be confirmed.
- Renoise: Lucidity would crash on exit in Renoise when using more than
  12 Lucidity instances in a project. 

=== BETA v0.0.1.50 (28-Aug-2014) ===
Bug Fix:
- replace sample function now works again. It seems I broke it in a recent update.

=== BETA v0.0.1.49 (26-Aug-2014) ===
Change:
- double clicking on a sample map item doesn't close the sample map.
- improved the browser. It would collapse whenever it was refreshed. 

Bug Fix:
- Legato mode reset the sample playback position when a note was released. 

=== BETA v0.0.1.48 (25-Aug-2014) ===
Change:
- some tweaks to the GUI styling.

=== BETA v0.0.1.47 (24-Aug-2014) ===
New:
- Add "Oped Data Folder..." command to Lucidity's main menu.
- The SFZ import now attempts to detect if looping should be enabled for a key group. 
- "Merge All Key Groups" command added. 
- "Rename Key Group" command added.
- "Open Sample" with external audio editor command added to the sample display context menu.
- "Reload Sample" command added.
- Rename sample file command added. (This is a destructive file rename.)

Change:
- ADSR envelopes now have a 0ms minimum attack time. Previously it was ~3ms. 
- Lucidity now has 64 preset FXP slots.
- Removed the alternative sample zoom in view. Now the sample is zoomed in place without 
  changing the GUI layout. 
- Changed the way loop points are handled. (Attempting to make the handling more transparent and intuitive.)
- Default key group trigger mode is now "NOTE". (Looping is off by default.)

Bug Fix:
- Loop points weren't being read correctly. This fixed needs to be confirmed.

=== BETA v0.0.1.46 (21-Aug-2014) ===
New:
- Can now see all key groups in the sample map editor.   

Change:
- Tweaked error reporting code. Error reports now saved as "LudicityDataDir\Error Reports\Lucidity Bug Report.txt"
- Tweaked the sample map editing control visibility.

Bug Fix:
- Pressing the root note key on the sample map editor didn't trigger the sample.
- Attempt to fix a crash related to the sample map. Needs testing.

=== BETA v0.0.1.45 (19-Aug-2014) ===
Bug Fix:
- filter parameters didn't update correctly when changing key groups.

=== BETA v0.0.1.44 (19-Aug-2014) ===
Change:
- save patch directory now defaults to "user" patch directory.
- tweak sample map keyboard drawing. add octave notes.
- tweak sample map region drawing.

Bug Fix:
- Can now load SFZ files that don't contain any <group> tags. 
- loop points aren't being read from wavefiles when SFZ files are loaded.
- SFZ loop_mode opcode wasn't being imported correctly.
- sample loop indicators weren't showing at the correct time.
- sample region boundary edit boxes weren't in the correct order.


=== BETA v0.0.1.43 (18-Aug-2014) ===
Change:
- Disabled horizontal sample map snapping.
- reworked the sample map region copy code. (Hold ALT to drag-copy a region.)

Bug Fix:
- SFZ Import: Previously Lucidity wasn't able to import a SFZ Opcode if it was 
  on the same line as a <region> or <group> opcode. Lucidity expected all <region>
  and <group> opcodes to seperated on individual lines. 
- The AHDSR envelopes ignored the "Velocity Depth" parameter. 
- Dragging a sample over the sample map would change the current sample selection.
- Voice stealing could cause clicks as active voices are quickly muted.
- added a minumum attack time of 3ms to the AHDSR envelopes.
- newly added regions are now selected in the sample map display.



=== BETA v0.0.1.41 (14-Aug-2014) ===

New:
- SFZ Import now working!
- SFZ files can be loaded via dragging and dropping on sample display.
- SFZ files now show in the browser. 
- Changed the knob modulation edit drawing.
- Knob modulation depth can now extend pass the maximum knob value.
- Drag and drop a folder on the Lucidity browser to add it. 
- Add rename sample directory option.
- The sample display now shows "Loading Program" when dragging and dropping a supported program file
  on the sample display.

Change: 
- Changed the way the LFO rates are calculated. A maximum LFO Frequency 
  is calculated to match the current LFO sync division. The LFO Rate
  now interpolates between 0hz and the Maximum LFO Frequency. Previously 
  the LFO Rate would snap to multiples of the faster sync rate. 
- The Attack-Decay, Attack-Release and Cycle LFO types have changed. 
  Instead of individual control over the Attack and Decay/Release stages, 
  the LFO mode has total time (RATE) and shape (BIAS) controls. Bias 
  changes the shape from a downwards saw -> triangel -> upwards saw
- Changed the LFO sync options. 
- Made a few tweaks to the ADSR parameter scaling to ease importing 
  SFZ and other formats.
- The Lucidity patch format has been changed. Patches are now saved
  useing "Patch Format Version 2". Lucidity is still capable of loading
  Version 1 format patches. 

Bug Fixes:
- lucidity would crash when deleting a directory in the file browser.
- Now using File Open/Save Dialogs that are compatible with Windows XP. 
  Newer Windows Vista style dialogs will be used on Vista machines an up.     
- Lucidity now expects the key file extension to be ".key" instead of ".dat"
- Clear all modulation wouldn't cause a knob's Min/Max mod amount range to update.
- Lucidity would crash when reszing a sample region to a very thin area.




=== BETA v0.0.1.38 (7-Aug-2014) ===
Rewrote the internal messaging system. Previously components could only send messages
to the GUI. Now components can send messages to audio and other non-visual components. 

The step sequence controls have been moved to seperate tabs. 

Lfo Controls Updated
- The LFO has been page-afied. Only one LFO can be edited at a time. 
- Added an additional LFO parameter. 
- Added Attack-Decay LFO envelope shapes.

Add Duplicate Regions command to the sample map context menu.

A modulation slot can now be muted. 

Knob parameter changes are now smoothed.
