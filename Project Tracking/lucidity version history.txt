== Finished for the next release ==

Bug Fix:
- SFZ Import: Previously Lucidity wasn't able to import a SFZ Opcode if it was 
  on the same line as a <region> or <group> opcode. Lucidity expected all <region>
  and <group> opcodes to seperated on individual lines. 
- The AHDSR envelopes ignored the "Velocity Depth" parameter. 




=== BETA v0.0.1.41 (14-Aug-2014) ===

New:
- SFZ Import now working!
- SFZ files can be loaded via dragging and dropping on sample display.
- SFZ files now show in the browser. 
- Changed the knob modulation edit drawing.
- Knob modulation depth can now extend pass the maximum knob value.
- Drag and drop a folder on the Lucidity browser to add it. 
- Add rename sample directory option.
- The sample display now shows "Loading Program" when dragging and dropping a supported program file
  on the sample display.

Change: 
- Changed the way the LFO rates are calculated. A maximum LFO Frequency 
  is calculated to match the current LFO sync division. The LFO Rate
  now interpolates between 0hz and the Maximum LFO Frequency. Previously 
  the LFO Rate would snap to multiples of the faster sync rate. 
- The Attack-Decay, Attack-Release and Cycle LFO types have changed. 
  Instead of individual control over the Attack and Decay/Release stages, 
  the LFO mode has total time (RATE) and shape (BIAS) controls. Bias 
  changes the shape from a downwards saw -> triangel -> upwards saw
- Changed the LFO sync options. 
- Made a few tweaks to the ADSR parameter scaling to ease importing 
  SFZ and other formats.
- The Lucidity patch format has been changed. Patches are now saved
  useing "Patch Format Version 2". Lucidity is still capable of loading
  Version 1 format patches. 

Bug Fixes:
- lucidity would crash when deleting a directory in the file browser.
- Now using File Open/Save Dialogs that are compatible with Windows XP. 
  Newer Windows Vista style dialogs will be used on Vista machines an up.     
- Lucidity now expects the key file extension to be ".key" instead of ".dat"
- Clear all modulation wouldn't cause a knob's Min/Max mod amount range to update.
- Lucidity would crash when reszing a sample region to a very thin area.




=== BETA v0.0.1.38 (7-Aug-2014) ===
Rewrote the internal messaging system. Previously components could only send messages
to the GUI. Now components can send messages to audio and other non-visual components. 

The step sequence controls have been moved to seperate tabs. 

Lfo Controls Updated
- The LFO has been page-afied. Only one LFO can be edited at a time. 
- Added an additional LFO parameter. 
- Added Attack-Decay LFO envelope shapes.

Add Duplicate Regions command to the sample map context menu.

A modulation slot can now be muted. 

Knob parameter changes are now smoothed. 


=== Alpha Version 0.0.1.19 released 5th February ===
