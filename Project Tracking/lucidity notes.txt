                           NOTES
================================================================================




==Note==

Maybe release a LE/Lite and XL/XE/Pro version.

LE version only has sample playback mode. No groups.

XL version has more sample playback modes (Loops, granular) and groups.

XL + Stuff bundle is more again plus a larger sample library.


==Note==
Naunce - A compact sampler from New Sonic Arts
http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=375258&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0

The Mangle - a granular sampler.

==NOTE==
Listening to Hydatid
- i want to be able to do tempo synced looping / repeats.. with clicks at the fade points.
  IE. there has to be the option for no crossfading.


* Listening to Chute by Auma & Desiseq
  on the Frag'mnts compilation.
  The bass tone has a sci-fi wobble!

  



==NOTE==

I'd also add that it's possible to perceptually optimize interpolation.
For example it can make sense to allocate extra complexity (a higher
order polynomial interpolator, precomputation and memory in the form of
oversampled wavetables, and so on) to the first tens of milliseconds of
a note and then switch to linear, because of the gradual rolloff of
typical instrumental sounds and forward temporal masking.

=== Getting serious about business ====
Option 1:
Release Lucidity as a fully functional demo with Nag screen. 

In the best case sceneario:
- lots of people would use it, some percentage would buy it. 
- deter usage of cracks. (why crack when the demo is fully functional)
- a large install base could utilised to get an idea of how big the music making 
  community is. From there I can make better business decisions about future products. 

Targets
- People who regularly make music with computers. Occasionally users will not need to purchase nor feel the compulsion to purchase a new shiny product. 

Pros
- Lucidity would have a presence in the communitity it probably wouldn't acheive if
  every user had to purchase it.   
- Automatic checking for updates would allow me to gather intelligence on the size of
  the music make community. 
Cons
- Probably reduce the number of impulse buys. 
- Probably still get cracked.


Option 2:
Release Lucidity using the "no demo" option.

In the best case sceneario:
- Really good marketing and sales causes people to get Gear Lust and slap down
  cash to buy something new. 
- A bit cynical perhaps but I think this would be effective with selling to very occasional music producers who spend as much time on forums reading about gear as they 
do making it. 

Targets
- People who impulse buy music software. Might not neccesarily be the same people who make music regularly. 

Pros
- If it works, it would generate immediate cash.

Cons
- Relies on quality of marketing to sell the software. 



Option 3:
Use a demo. 

In the best case sceneario:
- Lots of people check out the demo, see the program is really good and buy it to
  unlock extra functionality.

Questions: 
- More likely to translate demo installs to sales compared to Option 1. (as a percentage but perhaps not volume?)

Cons
- If the software is shit, it won't sell. If it's not immediately useful it might not sell.- Limits install base compared to option 1.


Option 4:
Start kickstarter. Ask for $60000 to release Lucidity as freeware release.

  Random LFO types
================================================================================

Random Type possiblities.

* R2, R3, R5, R7
- Rate
- Chaos
Choose between X random states, Chaos controls how often the random states change.


* Brownian Smooth, Brownian Step.
- Rate
- Distance.


* Random Smooth, Random Step
- Rate
- Chance of change.


* Wiggle Smooth, Wiggle Step
* Rate
* Chaos
A complex chaos source that randomly changes it's rate, degree of change
and amount of change.

A Sampler for Samplists.




= Loop Mode =
no_loop: no looping will be performed. Sample will play straight from start to end, or until note off, whatever reaches first.
one_shot: sample will play from start to end, ignoring note off.
This mode is engaged automatically if the count opcode is defined.
loop_continuous: once the player reaches sample loop point, the loop will play until note expiration.
loop_sustain: the player will play the loop while the note is held, by keeping it depressed or by using the sustain pedal (CC64). The rest of the sample will play after note release.



Marketing Tag - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAMPLE?





Listen to "Sea See" by machine drum. Listen to the background textures. 
recreate with Lucidity. (Tempo synced LFOs)
