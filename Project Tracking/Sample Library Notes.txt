Yann (Waveshaper) drup map conventions

I try to stick to some "conventions" to map the samples :
C is a bassdrum,
C# is either a 2nd bassdrum or a rimshot
D is a snare
D# is either a clap or a 2nd snare
E is another snare
F, G, A, B are toms or percussive sounds (sometimes FX with low end)
F#, G#, A# are hats (F# closed, A# open. G# is either a variation of F#, with accent or semi-open, or a casaba/maracas sound, depending on the sampled gear).
Then, depending on what's left :
upper C, D, E are SFX or percussion
C# and D# are cymbs (ride / crash) or maracas/tamburine/casaba
Many drum machines are mapped that way, so many people will "feel at home" with such a mapping.
