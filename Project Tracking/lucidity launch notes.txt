The pre-launch schedule is:

Testing for serious and obivous show stopping bugs. 
- Does it run in all major VST hosts? 
- Does it run on Windows 7/8?
- Does the GUI show etc?

== Alpha Stage 2 ==
Testing the sound engine and tweaking sound engine parameters. 
- Does it sound good? 
- What can be changed to improve musical usefulness?

Testing for bugs. All bugs will be fixed before moving onto the next stage.

works as expected. Feature set is now frozen. Nothing new will be added until 
version 1.1.
