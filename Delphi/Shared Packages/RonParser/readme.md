# Ron's Gui Markup Language

## What's with the name?

I went to the skatepark one day and there was this young dude there, Ron. He 
was dishing out tips and opinions like they were kittens.  
> Oh man, that's not the way to do a kickflip!. You gotta do it like this...
> 
> Your jeans are too baggy! You need some tight jeans like these!
> 
> You can't skate a half pipe with those wheels!

This markup language is helpful when building GUI's. Therefore I decided to name it 
after Ron as he was super helpful in the park that day.
