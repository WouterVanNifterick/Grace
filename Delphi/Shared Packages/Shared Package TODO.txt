================

Open Grace project for the first time in a long time. Project was using SmartInspect package.
Grace couldn't compile using the SmartInspect_RunTime package. 
The SmartInspect_RunTime appears to be a combination of some original code with units pulled
from the true smart inspect code base. There was some sort of conflict, the smart inspect code
was being used by my package and the true SmartInspectDXE package.

I resolved the problem in Grace by removing use of the SmartInspect_RunTime package. It's possible
Poise doesn't use this package either. Perhaps the package can be deleted.
