DVSTUtils unit: function documentation
======================================

function FourCharToLong(C1, C2, C3, C4: Char): Longint;
     This function converts four chars to a longint in the format required
     by Cubase VST for the identifier of the effect.

function FMod(d1, d2: Double): Double;
     Gets the remainder after the floating point division of d1 and d2.

procedure dB2string(value: Single; text: PChar);
     Converts value to a null terminated string representation in decibels.

procedure dB2stringRound(value: Single; text: PChar);
     Converts value to a null terminated string representation in decibels
     after having rounded it.

procedure float2string(value: Single; text: PChar);
     Converts the floating point variable value to a null terminated string
     representation.

procedure long2string(value: Longint; text: PChar);
     Converts the integer variable value to a null terminated string
     representation.

procedure float2stringAsLong(value: Single; text: PChar);
     Converts the floating point variable value to a null terminated string
     representation with nothing after the decimal point.

procedure Hz2string(samples, sampleRate: Single; text: pchar);
     converts samples in combination with sampleRate to Hz (I don't know this unit).

procedure ms2string(samples, sampleRate: Single; text: pchar);
     converts samples in combination with sampleRate to milliseconds.

function gapSmallValue(value, maxValue: Double): Double;
     Converts value (between 0 and 1) to an unevenly spread representation
     between 0 and maxValue. Unevenly spread means lower values take longer
     to change while higher values change quicker. To see what I mean, you
     can download my Squarize plugin from the Development section of
     http://www.axiworld.be. The Steps parameter uses this function.

function invGapSmallValue(value, maxValue: Double): Double;
     This is the inverse operation of gapSmallValue. When you have altered
     the value internally with gapSmallValue and Cubase requests this value,
     use this function to return the representation between 0 and 1 from
     a range of 0 to maxValue.

function logZ(z, x: Double): Double;
     This function calculates the logarithm with base z of the value x.
