The AggPasMod source here is currently a hacking together of code from the official source repository
and my own changes.

The official source is dated 2012-12-06

My changes include replacing sections of with units pulled from earlier versions of AggPasMod
- The most up to date build wasn't compiling for me when using in Lucidity.

Agg2D.pas is an old version as well. The newest version removes the PixelFormat property. My 
images were all rendering with inverted colors. RGBA was translated to BGRA. Annoying.
