    Drawing Text is Problematic
=========================================

Windows DrawText() method is the cleanest method for
generating text.

DrawText() uses ClearType. I'm not sure if there is a way to turn off that feature.

When using ClearType, DrawText() needs to draw onto a 100% opaque buffer as it 
blends with the background colors. 

DrawText() needs a device context, a TBitmap object is a pretty easy option here. 


SetBkMode() might be useful.

    Compositing Options
=========================================


Option 1: 
Individual controls maintain a backbuffer image of theirselves. 

The TopContainer blits controls backbuffers onto the TopContainer backbuffer.

Pros:
- A control in only redrawn when something in it changes. 

Cons
- Semi-transparent colors are tricker for controls to use. They must ensure
  the semi-transparent regions are set correctly.
- Difficult/Impossible to render ClearType text on transparent controls.


Option 2:
The TopContainer copies the backbuffer into the backbuffer of a child control. The 
child control then draws onto it's internal backbuffer. The TopContainer control
then blits the child's modified buffer back onto the master backbuffer. 

Pros
- Semi-transparent colors are easier to draw. 

Cons
- A control is redrawn each time the master backbuffer is invalidated. 




Option 3:
Child controls are passed a 'Drawing Object' that is used to draw the 
the child control to the TopContainers back buffer.

Pros
- Avoid blitting to and from temporary backbuffers.
- semi-transparent regions are drawn correctly with minimum fuss.

Cons
- Maybe difficult to ensure teh 'drawing object' works. The view port
  would need to be updated for each control and all drawing operations
   will need to take the view port size and location into account.
- Controls will be redrawn each time the master backbuffer is 
  invalidated.
