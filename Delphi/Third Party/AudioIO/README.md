================

AudioIO is based on WaveIOX by Tobias Fleischer, which in turn is based on
WaveIO by Carlos Barbosa.

WaveIOX was used as a guide while writing AudioIO. Some code has been copied
verbatim. Other sections were heavily modified or ignored. AudioIO extends on
WaveIOX by adding support for more audio formats.
