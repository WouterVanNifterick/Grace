It would be nice if there was a button to load the currently selected
sample automatically. This would come in handy for going through a
folder of samples using the arrow keys and hearing them in place
(with the current filter, tuning, envelope settings etc).

The current options of double-clicking or dragging and dropping are a
bit slow for this way of working. NI Maschine has a button like this
and it works well.

It is possible already to quick-load by holding Ctrl (Win) or Cmd (OSX)
and then using the Up/Down arrows. This will load the sample immediately
(same in Granite too). But indeed, some kind of quick load mode could
make it easier to load with the mouse hand and play MIDI with the other...

how about adjustable anti-click fades for start/end positions? Playing with
start/end points on drum loops results in clicks.
