Lucidity SFZ Import - Supported SFZ Opcodes

Both the <group> and <region> opcodes are recognised. 
<group> elements are translated to Lucidity Key Groups.
<region> elements are translated to Lucidity Sample Regions. 


These opcodes are only supported when used as part of a <group>
- fil_type
- cutoff
- resonance
- fil_keytrack
- fil_veltrack
- fileg_attack
- fileg_hold
- fileg_decay
- fileg_sustain
- fileg_release
- fileg_depth
- amp_veltrack
- ampeg_attack
- ampeg_hold
- ampeg_decay
- ampeg_sustain
- ampeg_release

These opcodes are only supported when used as part of a <region>
- sample
- lokey
- hikey
- lovel
- hivel
- pitch_keycenter
- end
- loop_start
- loop_end
- loop_mode
- transpose
- tune
- volume
- pan





== If the loop mode isn't specified for a key group ==
If the loop mode hasn't been set for a key group, we look for the first sample in the region. 
If we can find it, and if it has loop points set in the the source file, we set the
loop mode to "Loop Continuous". We do this because SFZ doesn't need to specify a loop 
mode. Nor does the SFZ format specify what the default loop mode setting should be.
